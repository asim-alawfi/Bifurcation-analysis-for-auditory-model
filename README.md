# Matlab-Scripts-Auditory-Model-Part1-
These scripts perform bifurcation computations for the auditory model (based on experimental data).
They should be run in sequence, as each script ends with a `save(...)` command and the next script begins with a `load(...)` command.
Once all the scripts have been executed, the results (figures) can be generated by running the script `Plot_auditory_model_original_case_submissionversion.m`, which will produce the necessary figures.
Essential first steps to run the scripts:
1) From the repository called **Matlab-Supporting-Functions-for-Auditory-Model**, download the MAT file called `sol23_2df.mat`.
2) The first script that must be run is `branch_of_sympos_original_case_and_threshold_crossing.m`, where the first line is `load(sol23_2df.mat)`."
